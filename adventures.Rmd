I like to go on outdoor adventures. Here are some pictures from recent trips I've taken.

In January and February 2019, I rafted the Grand Canyon on a 30 day private permit with a group of women and queer folks.
First is a photo from Havasu, which flows into the Colorado river (I'm in the yellow drysuit on the right).
