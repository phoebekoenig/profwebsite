I like to go on outdoor adventures. Here are some pictures from recent trips I've taken.

In January and February 2019, I rafted the Grand Canyon on a 30 day private permit with a group of women and queer folks.
First is a photo from Havasu, which flows into the Colorado river (I'm in the yellow drysuit on the right).

Here's me rappelling off the back of the 2nd Flatiron in Boulder, CO, October 2019.
